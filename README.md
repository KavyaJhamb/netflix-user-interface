This project was developed as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) class to demonstrate the practical application of a doubly linked list. The system simulates a movie navigation interface where users can view details about movies and navigate through them using "Previous," "Next," or "Random Access" buttons. Additionally, users can directly select a movie from a dropdown list and go to its details.

Key features include:

Sequential navigation using a doubly linked list.
Random access to any movie in the list.
Dynamic updates of movie details (title, description, genre, release date).
